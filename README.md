## 3️⃣ **Working the Issue**
   - **Objective**: Resolve the issue by following basic troubleshooting steps.
   - **Steps**:
     1. **Troubleshoot the Issue**: 
        - Check if the printer is online.
        - Verify that the user is selecting the correct printer.
        - Check and see if the printer ink or paper needs to be replaced
        - Restart the printer and try printing a test page.
     2. **Collaborate if Needed**: If basic troubleshooting doesn’t resolve the issue, involve a Level 2 technician or check with the network team.
     3. **Test the Fix**: Once the issue is resolved, print a test document to confirm everything is working.

 **Example**:   
   You discover that the user had selected the wrong printer from the list. After guiding them to choose the correct one, the issue is resolved.

## 4️⃣ **Resolution**
   - **Objective**: Confirm the fix and close the ticket.
   - **Steps**:
     1. **Confirm with the User**: Ask the user to print another document and confirm that the issue is resolved.
